The 'Rank Predictor' model predicts the rank of players from a Rocket League match by importing a csv file of statistics describing the gameplay. 
These statistics are saved offline however the above code contains the data processing steps as well as the various models created. This model
was produced during my final yeaar project at Durham University as part of my degree.

The 'Match Predictor' model predicts the outcome of a given tennis match along with a percentage indicating the level of confidence in the prediction. I am undertaking this project in my spare time and it is ongoing. Currently I am still in the data processing stage and I am in the process of creating the dataset the model will be trained on.
